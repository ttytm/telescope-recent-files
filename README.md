# Telescope recent files extension

This is an extension for the [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
plugin which implements a picker for the recent files.

The picker presents all files from `:h v:oldfiles` + the files which have been opened
in the current session. There are also a couple of useful [options](#options).

How does it differ from:

- Telescope's native `:h builtin.oldfiles`. Old files in [Neo]vim are saved only
  when the program is closed. So if you open the file you haven't worked on before,
  the builtin picker will not show it, which is sometimes quite annoying. This
  plugin addresses this use case by taking into account all buffers you opened.

- [Frecency](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-frecency.nvim) extension.
  Frecency is a fancier extension with smart algorithms, and persisting the results
  to the local database. However, frecency is not recency. This extension is much
  simpler - the algorithm is as dumb as it can be (whatever opened last is shown last),
  and there is also no local database to maintain.

## Installation

With [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
-- Required.
use {"nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim"}
-- This extension.
use {"smartpde/telescope-recent-files"}
```

## Usage

Once installed, the extension has to be loaded using standard Telescope's API:

```lua

-- Load extension.
require("telescope").load_extension("recent_files")
```

An example of the shortcut to open recent files:

```lua
-- Map a shortcut to open the picker.
vim.keymap.set("n", "<Leader><Leader>", require('telescope').extensions.recent_files.pick, { silent = true })
```

## Options

Extension options can be configured in the Telescope's setup:

```lua
require("telescope").setup {
  defaults = {
    -- Your regular Telescope's options.
  },
  extensions = {
    recent_files = {
      -- This extension's options, see below.
    }
  }
}
```

The extension provides the following options:

- `stat_files` (default `true`).

  Defines if the files should be checked for existence before showing in the pickers.
  When working on remotely mounted filesystems, it is helpful to turn it off in
  order to eliminate an extra latency when showing the pickers. At the cost of
  [potentially] showing non-existing files.

- `ignore_patterns` (default `{"/tmp/"}`).

  The list of file patterns to ignore in the picker. These are the standard [Lua patterns](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html).
  If you're opening some logs or other temporary files, you can configure the ignore
  patters in order not to clutter the pickers.

- `only_cwd` (default `false`).

  Show only files in the cwd.

- `transform_file_path` (default `function(file_path) return file_path end`).

  This is a Lua function to modify the file path for each entry in the pickers,
  before it gets displayed. If you return `nil` or `""`, the file will not be shown.
  Note that this function does not affect how the file path is displayed, use
  `:h telescope.defaults.path_display` for this.

- `show_current_file` (default `false`).

  If true, the file opened in the current window will be also shown in the picker.
  By default, the current file is not displayed as it is already open. But this
  behavior can be tuned according to one's liking.
